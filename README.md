# thruster_depth_plotter

This repository provides a simple tool to extract and visualize **depth data** and **thruster command inputs** from a ROS 2 bag file.

(update required like massively but try running it yourself)

1.place your bag on the same directory as the python file (i'll try updating this)
2.run the bag_converter to convert the bag into ~~islam~~ wait i mean csv
3.run the bag_plot to plot it into png then you can save it for later (imma add this so it plot into pdf later today)
4.change the code accordingly, read the bag info from the metadata.yaml file (only if needed)


this code is 90% chatGPT + 10% hopes and dream so good luck
