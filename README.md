# thruster_depth_plotter

A simple tool to extract and visualize **depth data** and **thruster command inputs** from a ROS 2 bag file.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Update Required:** This script needs major improvements, but hey, give it a try! 

## How to Use  

1. **Place** your bag file in the same directory as the Python script. _(I'll try to automate this later.)_  
2. **Run the bag converter** to transform the bag into ~~islam~~ wait, I mean **CSV**.  
3. **Run the bag plotter** to generate a PNG plot. _(I'll make it save as a PDF soon!)_  
4. **Modify as needed** by checking the `metadata.yaml` file to read the correct bag info.
